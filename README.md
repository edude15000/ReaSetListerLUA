NOTE: At the current moment, this script may only work on Mac - I have not tested on PC yet.
NOTE: At the current moment, loading an old saved setlist after editing regions in your DAW will revert your changes! 
There is a warning confirmation pop up so you don't mess anything up. Retaining changes while loading an old setlist is the next thing I am working on!

To run:
1. Put the .lua file in your REAPER /scripts directory - on Mac it is probably /Library/Application Support/REAPER/Scripts
2. Open Reaper, click on the Actions tab, click 'Show Actions List...', click 'ReaScript: Run ReaScript (EEL2 or lua)...', click on the lua file you added in the previous step
