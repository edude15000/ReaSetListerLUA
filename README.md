NOTE: At the current moment, loading an old saved setlist after editing regions in your DAW will revert your changes! 
There is a warning confirmation pop up so you don't mess anything up. Retaining changes while loading an old setlist is the next thing I am working on!

To run:
1. Put the .lua file and the rtk folder in your REAPER /scripts directory
   a. Mac - it is probably /Library/Application Support/REAPER/Scripts
   b. PC - it is probably C/Users/{user}/AppData/Roaming/REAPER/Scripts
2. Open Reaper, click on the Actions tab, click 'Show Actions List...', click 'ReaScript: Run ReaScript (EEL2 or lua)...', click on the lua file you added in the previous step
3. Optional - create a button that maps to running this script as an action for quick use!

For help and functionality, click the '?' button
